This module is done to manage maintenance contracts.

	A maintenance contract is structured this way:
    -	Client
    -	Signature date
    -	Due date
    -	Object
    -	Price and payment method
    -	Client’s obligations
    -	Recipient’s obligations
    -	Responsibilities
    
The following fields ‘Client’s obligations’, ’ Recipient’s obligations’ and ’ Responsibilities’ are multiple choices so the data entered can be used again on creating a new contract.
